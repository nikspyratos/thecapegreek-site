# Reading

These are my favourite books on all sorts of topics.

## Self Improvement

- Robert Glover - No More Mr. Nice Guy
- Mark Manson - The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck
- Viktor Frankl - Man's Search for Meaning
- Greg McKeown - Essentialism The Disciplined Pursuit of Less 

### Robert Glover - No More Mr. Nice Guy

**The** starting point for a young man looking how to improve the way he relates to the world. In short, it's about owning your emotions and helping others _because you want to_, not because _you want something from them_.

### Mark Manson - The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck

A book about priorities. It's a very big world out there, and can quickly become overwhelming. Maybe Mark Manson's writing will help settle your mind on the things you want to focus on.

### Viktor Frankl - Man's Search for Meaning

The first half is a harrowing account of life in the Auchwitz camp during World War II. The latter half, is to explain how anyone managed to persevere in that environment, exploring the then-new field of _logotherapy_ -- One's _logos_ ("word", purpose) to live.

### Greg McKeown - Essentialism - The Disciplined Pursuit of Less

Greg McKeown dives into what is called essentialism - the idea of pursuing only what you truly value instead of trying to do everything at once. Similar in concept to The Subtle Art above, yet distinct its own ways. If you're into minimalism, you'll like this.

## Dating & Sexuality

- Mark Manson - Models
- Zan Perrion - The Alabaster Girl 
- Janet W. Hardy - The Ethical Slut
- Barefoot Doctor - Barefoot Doctor’s Handbook for Modern Lovers The Tao of Amazing Sex

### Mark Manson - Models

One might be tempted to seek more "taboo" _pickup artist_ advice depending on their dating goals. But that advice does not address the real problem many men have: they are not comfortable with themselves, and thus they can't express themselves effectively to people they'd like to be friends with or date. This is the sort of thing that takes years to improve upon, and I can't say i've mastered anything myself. That being said, if you read nothing else on this list, **this is definitely the book to go for.**

Next to _The Alabaster Girl_ below, this is one of my favourite books of all time.

In short: this is a book of simple truths, yet hard realisations.

### Zan Perrion- The Alabaster Girl

One of my all-time favourite books on everything related to the dating dance.

If you find yourself seeking a manifesto for love, or wondering "why bother?", this is great place to start. In this book, Zan Perrion calls you and all men to a higher standard of interacting with ourselves, women, and the world.
Why? Why not? There's a discontentment in today's men as many have lost touch with their inner Lover. How better to rekindle this than a tale of seduction?

Side note: If you read this and enjoy this, I'd also recommend the [In Search of the Alabaster Girl](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWq2SGn4F-GGJCwQBGDM9ZtrRNtZe6Q2o) video series on Youtube. It's essentially an extended commentary on the book & discussion on the topics at hand.

### Janet W. Hardy - The Ethical Slut 

Even if you're not into polyamory or non-monogamy, this is an interesting read and can open up your horizons on the many different ways to relate.

### Barefoot Doctor - Barefoot Doctor’s Handbook for Modern Lovers The Tao of Amazing Sex

I'm not a very religious person and as such not much of a Taoist as the Barefoot Doctor here, but his advice is very sound

## Masculinity

- David Deida - The Way of the Superior Man
- Moore & Gillette - King, Warrior, Magician, Lover

### David Deida - The Way of the Superior Man

Here, David Deida explores what it takes to be a man tackling on our common challenge areas: from career to women to relationships to spirituality (or as much of that as you believe in).

### Moore & Gillette - King, Warrior, Magician, Lover

A book of archetypes. Each archetype has a good and bad side. The King - Leader vs Tyrant. The Warrior - Valiant or Brute. And so on. Which one are you?

## Interpersonal

- Dale Carnegie - How to Win Friends and Influence People
- Daniel Goleman - Emotional Intelligence & Working with Emotional Intelligence
- Thomas Erikson, David John - Surrounded by Idiots

### Dale Carnegie - How to Win Friends and Influence People

A classic entrypoint to becoming more sociable. it contains timeless advice, despite sounding like a guide to being a salesman in the 1930s at times.

### Daniel Goleman - Emotional Intelligence & Working with Emotional Intelligence

These two books are hallmarks of understanding how people work and how to deal with them effectively. Numerous studies conducted and described, showing how all sorts of people react to all sorts of situations. More importantly, it highlights how one's childhood greatly affects their personality and actions, while being careful to highlight that this doesn't set their features & flaws in stone and that both can be changed.

### Thomas Erikson, David John - Surrounded by Idiots

How to understand those around you in a more simplified manner. It's a self-described simplified version of DISC profiling.

## Business & Work

- Cal Newport - Deep Work
- Paul Jarvis - Company of One
- Kim Scott - Radical Candor
- MJ DeMarco - The Millionaire Fastlane & Unscripted

### Cal Newport - Deep Work

Flow state, "being in the zone", and deep work are all synonymous. Cal Newport goes into what this entails, what you can do to cultivate it, and how to build ideal environments to foster it.

### Paul Jarvis - Company of One

While this is *mostly* about running a company solo, it also caters to intrapreneurship and being an effective "company of one" within an existing organisation. Definitely worth a read if you're looking to run your projects more independently. In the same vein are the Make Book by Pieter Levels and Zero to Sold by Arvid Kahl. 

### Kim Scott - Radical Candor

Radical Candor is oriented more toward leaders, but is very useful as a team member as well. By learning how to be direct and even explicit without going into being rude, you & your team can communicate with each other more effectively.

### MJ DeMarco - The Millionaire Fastlane & Unscripted

These two books can be considered fairly similar, so I've put them both here. In these MJ DeMarco discusses at length ways to change your life from the status quo and his ideas on how to create wealth for yourself.

## Physical & Mental Health

- Paul Wade - Convict Conditioning
- Sam Harris - Waking Up

Hmm, I do need to find a book on food.

### Paul Wade - Convict Conditioning

I'm a big fan of bodyweight fitness routines, for three reasons:

- I don't want to own too much equipment at home
- I don't want to have to pay for and travel to a gym
- I want something I could theoretically do anywhere, especially while travelling

As such, this a good book on it. This has the least amount of equipment (just a pullup bar or gym rings) possible while still targetting all muscle groups, and one of the core concepts of it is novel yet very powerful: on your repetition you do it as 1 second down, 1 second hold, 1 second up, 1 second rest. This 4 second repetition adds just a little bit of extra resistance to your exercising.

### Sam Harris - Waking Up

I'll be honest... I haven't read this. It is however in my current reading queue. I wanted to highlight it here however because of Sam Harris' *Waking Up* app, which provides guided meditations and many spiritual yet irreligious discussions.

I believe meditation is one of the best things you can do for your mental health. Even 10 minutes a day.

## Fiction

I really should read more fiction.
