# Welcome to my website!

Heyo, I'm Nik. I'm a Greek-South African software developer currently based in Cape Town. This website is a space for me to write, play, and share ideas.

## Community 

I'm very big on the value of tech communities. Active on [zatech.co.za](https://zatech.co.za) and participating in several others.

Former co-host of the [Cape Town PHP Group](https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-PHP-Group/), now organiser of [PHP South Africa](https://phpsouthafrica.org) alongside some awesome people. Feel free to check drop by the next meetup!

## Companies

Companies I've worked for include:

- Car & Classic: 2021-Present
- Superbalist: 2020
- TCT Digital: 2018-2019
- South African Broadband Education Networks: 2017-2018

## Projects

Like many other developers, I work on a few side projects. Not all of these are always completed, but the learning experience and research process is a way to keep sharp.

Recent projects include:

- Personal cloud automation with Ansible & Terraform
- Building this website with Jigsaw & Tailwind

Like most developers, I have opinions on things. This doesn't reflect the views of any client or employer of mine, past, present and future.
